All features nearly untested as always.

- Alter command added.
- Timeout and delayed database open added
- delete command now can check against data in key
- nbatch and nbatch0 added

You can now delete keys if the data is matching.
So if the data is not matching, no delete happens.

Also "alter" command added.  It works like "update"
but it does not update if there is no match of th old data.

Example:
<pre>
./dbm create test.db
./dbm insert test.db a b
./dbm alter  test.db a b c
./dbm alter  test.db a b c || echo "must fail now"
./dbm delete test.db a b || echo "must fail"
./dbm delete test.db a c
rm test.db
</pre>

Also timeout and delayed open added.  This allows more easy pipes:
<pre>
find . |
./dbm filter DB |
sort |
./dbm nbatch DB add
</pre>
The trick is, that the sort eats all data until the first dbm is
finished.  The second one delays the open until the first data
arrives.

The new commands nbatch and nbatch0 repairs "the empty key" phenomenon
in case you use dbm in pipe situations.  However it ignores the line
if the line terminator is missing.  This is helpful in situations
where you kill some process, so lines which are not complete are not
processed at all.  However, in situations where the last line
terminator might be missing you must use the command "batch" and
"batch0".
