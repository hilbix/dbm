Batch version of "alter" commands balter and balter0 added

There was a bug in the alter command in case the third argument was
not present.  This shall be fixed now.

The code now becomes more and more hacked.  This is not good.  So it
shall be rewritten from scratch with a more clean structure.  However
I do not have the time to do a clean rewrite (sigh).
