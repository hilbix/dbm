<b>Functions sadd and sdir removed for re-write</b>

The "find" function now returns FALSE in case it does not find anything.
This is to more easily differ from the case when it returns a blank result,
which, from shell, does look alike.

The "sadd" and "sdir" functions have proven badly designed, so they will be
re-invented with another algorithm.  This is an intermediate version which
removes the old "sadd" and "sdir" function.  If you need the old behavior,
stick to version 0.10.x
