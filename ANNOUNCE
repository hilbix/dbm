New feature nearly untested as always.

Better return value and messaging added.

Return value now is
<ul>
<li> 0=ok
<li> 1=key missing or database empty
<li> 2=key exists or cannot store
<li> 10=general other error
<li> 255=timeout
</ul>

The main reason for this change is "dbm delete" where now I can
distinguish if the key was deleted (0) or the key was missing (1) or
the key exists but has the wrong data (2), there was a retryable
timeout (-1=255).

There now is only one case where the database does not return true but
print2 no error to stderr: <tt>dbm get</tt> where the key is missing.
This is you can still `dbm get DB something` without stderr clutter,
and it will stay this way.
