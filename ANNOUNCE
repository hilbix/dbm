Memory leaks fixed, "bget"/"bget0" added and "list" improved

There was a memory leak as the allocated pointers were not freed.
Most commands did not have any problem, but all list commands which
read data from the database were affected:

filter, find, search, list, dump

Also there is a new command "bget" for a batch type get:
<pre>
find . -type f -print |
dbm bget DB/files '
' '
' |
while read -r file && read -r data
do
	: whatever
done
</pre>

Beware of filenames with LF in it.  Find knows a "-print0" so dbm
knows a "bget0", too.

Also the "list" command now is able to output NUL or other strings as
line terminator.
