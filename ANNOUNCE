Improved: Option -a
Added: Option -n and -u

Option -a still was too slow on outputs.  Now output is processed in
"batches", too.

Option -u flushes output as soon as meaningful.  Together with Option
-a this nearly brings back the old behavior (db close on each line).

Option -n suppresses fsync() on the GDBM file.  Changes in the DB are
factors faster on machines which are heavily loaded with IO.
Especially useful on option -a and batch commands.  However the DBM is
not synced anymore, so a sudden power loss can have a more bad impact
then it already has (often I observed that a sudden power loss
corrupts the DBM).
