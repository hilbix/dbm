Too tired to read docs?  make; ./dbm
Want a laugh?  read RANTS

This is a quick hack to access the contents of GNU-DBM files.

I often use GNU DBM in PHP to store some persistent data.  However I
was missing an utility to access this files from command line.

Therefore I wrote this here and called it "dbm" - well, stupid name ;)
Perhaps in future I might extend this to other simple database files,
too (like berkeley-db hash maps used in sendmail).  In this case the
file gets a prefix like "hash:" or "btree:".

Known bugs:

Currently you cannot search for data which contains a NUL.
