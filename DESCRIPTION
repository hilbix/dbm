DBM began as a quick hack just to access gdbm files from the
commandline.

It now has some batch and filter functions to be used in shell pipes,
but it is very little tested for now.

When you compile it, just ignore the error that make cannot cd into
"tino".  That's ugly, but as it's just a quickhack no tinolib shall be
required to compile it, and thus the current version of tinolib is not
part of this distribution.  Also note that there currently is no
tinolib distribution, as it's far from beeing ready.  For now it just
comes with other of my sources.

Short example what DBM can do for you, a JPG file checker:
<PRE>
./dbm create db.ok
./dbm create db.fail
find / -type f -name '*.jpg' -print |
./dbm filter db.ok |
./dbm filter db.fail |
sort |
while read -r a
do
        if djpeg "$a" >/dev/null
        then
                ./dbm insert DB/ok "$a" 1
        else
                ./dbm insert DB/fail "$a" 1
        fi
done
</PRE>
The "sort" is a hack to "buffer" the output, such that the database
files are closed when the loop runs.
